# Enquiry form_with Database
## This is HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL based project. In this project I have used HTML and CSS to design an enquiry form and for the backend I have used PHP. After that with the help of PHP and MySQL  I have created a database  and established a connection to database with mysqli_connect() function and insert the data in database with the help of SQL command. At last I have used  XAMPP  for a local server.
